# Task Automation

Task automation project, where Python reads a data table found in the "produtos.csv" folder and registers it in a supposed company's system.

Notice:
The project was created on a 1920x1080 resolution monitor, so if you run it on a different resolution monitor, the x and y coordinates will be different and this will cause the program to not work correctly.

To pause the program in the middle of execution, simply move the mouse cursor to the top left corner of the screen.

The step-by-step process for building the code is in the "main.py" code itself.
